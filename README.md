### Bracket Watch
## Goal 
The goal of this project is to gain experience using Docker, Terraform, TypeScript, Vue.js, and Tailwind CSS. Personally, this project will serve as a way for me to quickly see different scenarios for how a team can get a certain seed in the playoffs. As a long-time fan of the NFL, this is something you see quite frequently towards the end of the season when all the teams in the hunt are hoping for other teams to win/lose/tie so their team can get a shot in the playoff tournament.
## Scope 
+ Allow users to view what scenarios will allow their favorite team to make the playoffs
+ Allow users to view the odds that these scenarios occur based of gambling odds.
